# TensorFlow In Practise Specialization Coursera

## Course 1: Introduction to TensorFlow for AI, ML and DL

This first course introduces you to Tensor Flow, a popular machine learning framework. You will learn how to build a basic neural network for computer vision and use convolutions to improve your neural network.

## Course 2: Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow

This second course teaches you advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts. Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.
